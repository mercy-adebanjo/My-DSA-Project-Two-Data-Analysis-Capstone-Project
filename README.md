### Tools Used
- Power BI
 - Data cleaning
 - Data manipultion
 - Data munching
 - Data Cleanig and Preparation
   In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations,we perform the following actions;
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Handling missings variables
   - Data cleaning and formatting
### Expository data Analysis
EDA involves the exploring of data to answers some questions about the data.some of this questions are : 
- .1 What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments
- 2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
- 3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
- 4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
  - ● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
  - ● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
  - ● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
  - ● Also visualize this by regions
Case Questions
- 5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee
data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the
performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus
payments and asked you to:
  - ● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
  - ● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)
  - ● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

These include, step by steps of the Analysis of the Dataset.The analysis are thereby stated below:
